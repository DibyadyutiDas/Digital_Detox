# 🔐 Security Policy

## 📘 Overview

This repository is a personal and public collection of code examples, practice problems, and mini-projects across multiple languages (C, C++, Java, DSA, JavaScript, Web, etc.). It is intended for **educational purposes only**.

There are **no deployed services**, **no user data**, and **no backend logic** in this repository.

## 🛡️ Reporting Issues

If you discover a security-related issue or vulnerability in any code:

- Please **open an issue** describing the problem (if it's a logic flaw or potentially harmful pattern).
- You can also email me at: `dibyadyutidas@gmail.com` if the concern should remain private initially.
- I appreciate **responsible disclosure** and will review valid issues as soon as possible.

- Does **not run on a server**
- Does **not collect user data**
- Is not meant for **deployment to production**

...there is **no formal vulnerability disclosure program** or patch schedule.

## ✅ Best Practices Encouraged

If you’re contributing:
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data (tokens, passwords).
- Follow standard coding conventions for security (e.g., input validation).
- Don’t include compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.class`, `.out`).
